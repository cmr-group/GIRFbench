Sequence generation files for variouss forms of GIRFs

# Getting Started
A simple thin-slice measurement can be found in `make_simple_phantom_girf.ipynb`, that will demonstrate how to make a 5-slice, chirp measurement that can be acquired in a phantom, acquires multiple chirp waveforms (with slightly different parameters and prephasers).  It will acquire dasta on each gradient axis.


# pypulseq Helpers
To modularize the code, most pypulseq functionality is packages inside of object seen in the `helpers/` directory.
