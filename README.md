Software tools for measuring and processing GIRFs

# Status

**GIRFbench is currently in active development. The interface and features are expected to change. A large update with additional solvers, sequences, and example data will be added soon.**

# Getting started
Sample acquisitions and pre-generated Pulseq .seq files, as well as a more thorough README can be found in the `acquire/` folder.  Solvers and example of GIRF generation of the data can be found in the `solve/` folder.
